## Hi there, I'm Jarrod 👋

- I'm currently working as a Data Analyst, but I've been intrigued by Data Engineering lately. I'm always excited to learn cool new stuff, so this is where I keep my personal projects. 

## Certifications 📚:
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/f676d316-c626-4c69-81ec-7dadc9646478/public_url)

## Projects:
- :man_health_worker: [FDA-Adverse-Events-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/fda-adverse-events-pipeline) 💊
  - 🏥 Fun project looking at Adverse Events as reported to the FDA, specifically focusing on statin drugs (and potentially associated effects).
    - Tech used: dbt, Airflow, Snowflake, AWS S3, Astronomer Cosmos, Python, SQL
     
- 📜 [Planning-Center-Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/planning-center-data-pipeline) 😄
  - This one actually gets used every month to support a data analytics project in my own personal community. This project started with automating some repetitive monthly tasks with Python and quickly evolved into a mini-DE project.
    - Tech used: Airflow, Docker, AWS S3, Python, Beautiful Soup (web scraping), and Google Apps API
     
- :pilot: [OpenSky-Flight-Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/opensky-flight-data-pipeline) (In Progress...) :earth_asia:
  - Planning a trip to Japan :japan:, so I wanted to do a near-real time analysis of flights from US <--> Japan using the OpenSky API. I am thinking of experimenting with Kafka / streaming on this one  (more to come.)

- 🌱 I'm currently learning: 
    - Exploring Modern Data Tools / Platforms (dbt, Airflow, Databricks, Snowflake)
    - Everything Cloud. There's always more to learn when it comes to cloud. AWS is what I know best, but I'm always wanting to explore Azure and GCP more as well
    - Evolving Data Architecture best practices

Always looking to connect with folks who enjoy similar stuff - to discuss new opportunities, challenges, or whatever! 👍
