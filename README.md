## Hi there, I am Jarrod 👋

- I am currently working as a Data Analyst, but have been intrigued by Data Engineering as of late. 😄  I am always excited to learn cool new stuff, so this is where I keep fun personal projects. 

## Certifications 📚:
-  [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/f676d316-c626-4c69-81ec-7dadc9646478/public_url)

## Projects:
- :man_health_worker: [FDA-Adverse-Events-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/fda-adverse-events-pipeline) 💊
  - 🏥 Fun project looking at Adverse Events as reported to the FDA, specifically dealing looking at statin drugs.
    - Tech used - dbt, airflow, Snowflake, AWS S3, astronomer cosmos, python
     
- 📜 [Planning-Center- Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/planning-center-data-pipeline) 😄
  - This one actually gets used every month to support a data analytics project in my personal community. This project started with automating 🤖 some repetitive tasks on a monthly basis and quickly evolved in a mini-DE project!
    - Tech used - airflow, docker, AWS S3, python, Beautiful Soup (webscraping), and Google Apps API
     
- :pilot: [OpenSky-Flight-Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/JarrodWade/opensky-flight-data-pipeline) (In Progress...) :earth_asia:
  - Planning a trip to Japan :japan:, so wanted to do a fun analysis of flights from US <--> Japan using OpenSky API. I enjoy Apache-Spark, so planning to get the wheels turning on a smaller-scale project (at least for Spark standards), perhaps with a Databricks cluster (we'll see ... TBD 😉))


- 🌱 I am currenly learning: 
    - Exporing Modern Data Tools / Platforms (dbt, Airflow, Databricks, Snowflake)
    - Everything Cloud. There's always more to learn when it comes to cloud. AWS is what I know best, but always wanting to explore Azure and GCP more as well
    - Evolving Data Architecture best practices
